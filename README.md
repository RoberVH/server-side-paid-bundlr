#Server-side paid Bundlr loader

## A NextJS app
It shows how to paid with a server account for Clients content uploads 

Thanks to Jesse from Bundlr Discord (here at https://discord.gg/7PuzaDPR) for helping with server side uploading code

In a nutshell, this app allow to initiate a remote bundlr object at server and upload files from the client without client having to paid. 
A mechanism to filter which users could have their content paid for should be added to this basic code.
